## Reddit Post

I used to make websites for AAA games so I rebuilt the Hollow Knight website for fun.

Hey reddit, long time lurker on this sub, ya'll helped me stay sane in Hallownest. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I still listen to the soundtrack when I work to get all the feels back when I'm coding, since I'm basically doing the same thing and fighting bugs :)

I used to work full time building custom websites for a AAA game studio, but now I'm a freelance web designer/developer. I'm currently between clients with nothing to do and decided to polish up the Hollow Knight website, because I noticed their current website https://hollowknight.com is just a wordpress template and I think they deserve a slick custom site for such a masterpiece game.

- I kept all the same content/links/text. I didn't take any liberties with the text so the messaging is exactly the same as before, it's not my place to change any of that. I just gave it a redesign polish that highlights the amazing art and ambiance of the game, also added some interactive/dynamic elements to make the website feel more alive and engaging.

- Used more art from their official press kit. These guys have AMAZING art talent so I wanted to showcase as much of it on the website as I could.

- A lot of CTA's to buy the game, can't miss it, because that's one of the main goals of a game website is to sell copies of the game. And I hope these guys sell a million more copies because they deserve every bit of success.

- Optimized images, videos. Meaning faster load times. Their old site was 7.82 MB with a content load time of ~14 seconds on a 4G connection, that's too slow and most new visitors will just leave. I got that down to 2.12 MBs and 3.8 seconds on 4G and that's with more graphics.

- Mobile responsive down to 368px screen sizes and up to 2440px ('theoretically' there's no upper limit here)

- Tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, mobile safari, mobile chrome. I don't have a PC to check on IE/Edge but should be fine on all modern browsers.

- Other boring SEO stuff


If anyone from Team Cherry sees this, I'd love to offer the website to them for free, if they want it. The website is production ready so it would be plug n' play for them. I know they are just 3 guys and are probably swamped, especially with Silksong coming! I can't imagine they have the time or resources to spend designing and building a great website on top of their game dev tasks.

  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
